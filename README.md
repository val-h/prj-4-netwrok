# Project 4 - Network

My take on Harvard's CS50Web Project4, a social networking webapp where Users can register and be able to do the following:

- Create posts
  - Content field
  - Image field(uploaded to the server)
- Edit a post's content
- Following people
  - Dedicated page for posts by followed users
- Profile page for each user
  - Profile overview
  - Section for all of the user's posts
- Like feature for each post
- Pagination
  - Posts are loaded automatically when users reach the 
  end of the page
  - Loaded continuously until the last post is reached

 All of this acompanied with a minimalistic design which 
puts the focus on the images.

Showcase of the project can be found on ***[odysee](https://odysee.com/@val_dev:3/web50-prj-4-network:c)***

*** ### DISCLAMER - Work in progress ***

##### Current progress:
- Up and Running
- Static files
- Media files uploaded to the live server

##### Known issues:
- Media files from the databaase(default posts) not displayed
- Since the hosting is free, the server doesn't save files to the db after it starts to hibernate

Live demo of the project can be found on ***[heroku](https://network-val.herokuapp.com)***
