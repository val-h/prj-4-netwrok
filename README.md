# Project 4 - Network

My take on Harvard's CS50Web Project4, a social networking webapp where Users can register and be able to do the following:

 - Create posts
   - Content field
   - Image field(uploaded to the server)
 - Edit a post's content
 - Following people
   - Dedicated page for posts by followed users
 - Profile page for each user
   - Profile overview
   - Section for all of the user's posts
 - Like feature for each post
 - Pagination
   - Posts are loaded automatically when users reach the 
   end of the page
   - Loaded continuously until the last post is reached

 All of this acompanied with a minimalistic design which 
puts the focus on the images.
